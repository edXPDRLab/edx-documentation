Guidelines for Modifying Group Configurations
*********************************************

Review these guidelines if you must modify a group configuration after a course
starts. These guidelines apply for courses built in Studio or OLX.

==================================
Modifying a Group Configuration
==================================

After the course starts, **do not**:

* Delete group configurations.

* Change the ``id`` value of a group configuration.

=================
Modifying Groups
=================

After the course starts, **do not** change the ``id`` value of a group.
  
You can change group names at any time.

==========================================================
Removing Groups from Group Configurations
==========================================================

After a course has started, you may find that students in a specific group are
having difficulties or a poor experience. In this situation, you can remove the
group from the group configuration. Content that was specified for that
group is then no longer visible to students.

Students in the removed group are reassigned evenly to one of the other groups
in the group configuration. Any problems that these students completed in the
removed group content do not count toward the students' grades. The students
must begin the problem set again and complete all the problems in the group
content to which they've been reassigned.

Removing a group affects the course event data. Ensure that researchers
evaluating your course results are aware of the group you removed and the
date you removed it.
