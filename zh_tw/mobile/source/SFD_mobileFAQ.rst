========================================================
Can I take a course entirely on my mobile device?
========================================================

This beta version of our mobile app is a companion app that you can use to watch
course videos and see announcements and handouts. To complete readings, homework
problems, and exams, you can tap **View on Web** in the bottom right corner of
any screen to access the content in your browser, or you can complete
assignments on your computer.

========================================================
How do I post questions on the discussion board?
========================================================

Right now, you can't participate in discussions by using the app. However, when
you tap **View on Web** in the bottom right corner of any screen, the course
opens in your browser. You can then tap the **Discussion** tab in your course to
participate in discussions.

========================================
How do I change my download settings?
========================================

#. In the upper left corner of your **My Courses** page, tap the menu icon.

      :alt: Mobile "My Courses" page with an arrow pointing to the menu in the upper left corner

#. In the list that appears, locate **SETTINGS: Download only on Wi-Fi**, and
   then tap the option's current setting to change it.

.. note:: By default, the app is set so that it will only download content, 
  including videos, if you're on a Wi-Fi network. If you change this setting, 
  you may exceed the data allowance for your cellular plan.

========================================
How do I un-enroll from a course?
========================================

To un-enroll from a course, visit the edX website on your mobile browser or on
your computer.

================================================
How can I send questions or comments to edX?
================================================

We'd love to receive your feedback on this beta version of our mobile app. In
the app home page, tap the menu in the upper left corner, and then tap **Submit
Feedback**.


.. _Video Questions:

*************************
Video Questions
*************************

================================
How do I download videos?
================================

To download videos, tap the download icon that appears to the right of each
section, subsection, or video name. If you tap the download icon for a video,
you'll download just that video. If you tap the download icon for a section or
subsection, you'll download all of the videos in that section or subsection.

.. image:: /Images/Mob_DownloadIcon.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: List of sections with the download icon circled

================================================
How much data will the videos in this app use?
================================================

Course videos are optimized for mobile playback, but watching or downloading any
video can result in heavy data use. We recommend using a Wi-Fi connection if you
intend to watch or download a lot of videos. The edX app has a **Download only
on Wi-Fi** setting that's enabled by default to help you avoid using your
cellular network accidentally.

========================================================================
What are the numbers to the right of section and subsection names?
========================================================================

The number to the right of a section or subsection name is the number of videos
in that section or subsection.

.. image:: /Images/Mob_NumberVideos.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: List of sections with the number of videos circled

========================================================
What are the circles to the left of the video name?
========================================================

The circle indicates whether you've watched a video. A blue circle means that
you haven't started watching the video. A half-filled circle means that you've
watched part of the video. A gray circle means that you've watched the entire
video.

========================================
How can I make the video full screen?
========================================

Tilt your phone until the video changes to landscape, or tap the full screen
icon in the bottom right corner of the video screen.

.. image:: /Images/Mob_FullScreenIcon.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: Video in windowed mode with full screen icon circled

==================================
How can I see captions?
==================================

When you're playing a video, tap the gear icon in the lower right corner, and
then tap **Closed Captions**. If the video has captions, a list of available
languages for the captions appears. Tap the language that you want in the list.
Some captions are available in just one language, and others are available in
several languages.

.. image:: /Images/Mob_CCwithLanguages.png
   :width: 500
   :alt: Video with closed caption language menu visible

========================================================================================================================================
If I watch a course video in the mobile app, and then I access the course on a computer, will I be in the same place in the course?
========================================================================================================================================

Right now, your course activity on the mobile app doesn't affect your course
activity on your computer. That is, if you use your computer to access the
course, and then you watch a few videos on your mobile device, the next time you
access the course with your computer you'll return to the last page that you
viewed on your computer. You won't go to the last video that you watched on your
mobile device.

==================================
Can I speed up the videos?
==================================

Currently, the videos only run in their original speeds. We're currently working
on the ability to change video speeds.

==================================
How do I delete downloaded videos?
==================================

#. In the upper left corner of your home page, tap the menu icon, and then tap
   **My Videos**.
#. Tap the course that has the video that you want to delete.
#. At the bottom of the screen, tap **Edit**.
#. Tap to select the box that appears to the right of the video name, and then
   tap **Delete** at the bottom of the screen.
#. In the **Confirm Delete** dialog box, tap **Delete**.


.. _Troubleshooting:

*************************
Troubleshooting
*************************

======================================================================================================
I get a "This video is not available" screen when I try to watch a video. What can I do?
======================================================================================================

If you run into problems, make sure you have an Internet connection. If problems
persist, let us know: go to your **My Courses** page on the app, tap the menu
icon in the upper left corner, and then tap **Submit Feedback**.
